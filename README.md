# SIMPLE-BANK-WEBSITE-SPARKS-FOUNDATION
I’ve developed a simple banking website that serves as a basic platform for conducting essential banking operations. The site is designed to allow the creation of new user accounts, enable money transfers between customers, and provide a transaction history log. The key feature of this application is its simplicity; it operates without a user login page, which streamlines the process and makes it accessible for all users.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and PHP—a combination that ensures both functionality and ease of use. HTML provides the structure, CSS adds the styling, and PHP handles all the backend processes. This trio of technologies has allowed me to create a responsive and efficient web application that can be easily deployed on various servers.

One of the main attractions of this website is the direct and hassle-free money transfer system. Customers can be selected from a list, the desired amount entered, and the transaction completed in a matter of clicks. The transaction history is updated in real-time, reflecting the new balances immediately, which adds to the user-friendly experience.

This project is not just a demonstration of my web development skills but also an effective tool for those looking to understand the workings of web-based banking systems. It’s a practical example of how traditional web technologies can be utilized to create functional and straightforward applications. The code is organized and documented, making it easy for future enhancements and learning purposes.
